 The CanSat app is designed to provide a comprehensive visualization platform for CanSat
 (Can-sized satellite) projects, primarily aimed at Liquid Galaxy systems. CanSats are small,
 educational satellites that fit inside the volume of a standard soda can, designed to perform
 various scientific experiments and data collection tasks.
 In this app, users can access information about CanSat projects, including details about
 launches, competitions, and related events. They can explore interactive maps displaying the
 trajectories of CanSat launches and track the real-time status of the Liquid Galaxy system's
 connection.

 The main objectives of the CanSat app include:
 1. Providing users with information about CanSat projects, competitions, and events.
 2. Visualizing CanSat launch trajectories on interactive maps.
 3. Enabling users to track the connection status of the Liquid Galaxy system.
 4. Facilitating navigation to additional features such as project details, launch information, and
 settings.
